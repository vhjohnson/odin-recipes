        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An old and trusty recipe for carrot cake from Chef John.
            The recipe has been revamped with coconut oil.</p>
        <p>If you want to decorate it with candied carrots, simply 
            slice them thinly and boil for a couple minutes in a 
            syrup made from equal parts sugar and water.
        </p>

                <ul>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Place flour in a bowl. Add salt, baking soda, and 
                baking powder. Sprinkle in ground ginger and 
                cinnamon. Whisk thoroughly until combined. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Add sugar to a seperate bowl. Whisk in eggs until 
                mixture is smooth and pale yellow, 2 to 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Heat butter and coconut oil in a saucepan over low 
                heat until just melted but not too hot. Whisk into 
                the bowl with the eggs and sugar until well combined. 
                Add carrots, crushed pineapple, pecans, and walnuts. 
                Stir well.
            </li>
            <li>Stir flour mixture into the carrot mixture until 
                no dry spots remain. Pour batter into a greased 
                9x13-inch baking pan. Tap the pan against your 
                counter to let any big air bubbles rise to the surface.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted 
                into the cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Let 
                cool completely before frosting, at least 40 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Beat cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract together 
                using an electric mixture until light and fluffy. Gradually 
                beat in the confectioners' sugar to form a smooth frosting. 
                Spread evenly over the cooled cake. Chill completely before 
                slicing.
            </li>
        </ol>
